# 👋 Hey, I’m rxal99  

Just another curious mind exploring code, tech, and the occasional rabbit hole.  

- 🖥️ Languages I dabble in: Python, C, Bash  
- 🔍 Love solving puzzles, CTFs, and odd mysteries online  
- 📚 Currently obsessed with system internals & network security  
- 🎶 Music fuels my workflow (lofi + 80s retro)  
- 📺 Stranger Things fan — there’s always *something hidden in the Upside Down*  
- 🛠️ Building small tools & experiments, some of which end up here  

⚡ Fun fact: Half my repos start as experiments at 2AM and never end how I planned.
